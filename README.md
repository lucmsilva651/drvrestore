# drvrestore
A tool that makes restores a backup of all your drivers.

- For driver backup, use my another tool called [drvbackup](https://github.com/lucmsilva651/drvbackup/).

## Use
Just run the "restore_drivers.cmd" file and wait for the restore. All the drivers will be looked up in the system root drive, at the "Backup_Drv" folder.
